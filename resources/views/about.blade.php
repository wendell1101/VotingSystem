                An online voting system is a software platform that allows groups to securely conduct
                votes and elections. As a digital platform, this will help to eliminate the need to
                gather in-person, cast votes using paper, or by any other means. This is a group project
                of selected students of PUP STB BSIT 3-2 in fulfillment of the final requirements on
                Applications Development and Emerging Technologies.
